# Predicting the Spectral Class of a Star

This simple machine learning project aims to predict the spectral class of a star using multiple features such as the temperature, luminosity, radius, and absolute magnitude of the astrophysical object. The spectral class or stellar classification is a way to categorize stars based on their physical properties, mainly their _temperature_ and _color_. Stars are classified under the [Morgan-Keenan System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification), they are classified through letters _O, B, A, F, G, K,_ and _M_, where _O_ is the hottest and _M_ is the coolest. This simple study provides essential parameters for understanding stellar behavior which can be useful for further astrophysical analysis and scientific research.
