# Predicting the Spectral Class of a Star

This simple machine learning project aims to predict the spectral class of a star using multiple features such as the temperature, luminosity, radius, and absolute magnitude of the astrophysical object. The spectral class or stellar classification is a way to categorize stars based on their physical properties, mainly their _temperature_ and _color_. Stars are classified under the [Morgan-Keenan System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification), they are classified through letters _O, B, A, F, G, K,_ and _M_, where _O_ is the hottest and _M_ is the coolest. This simple study provides essential parameters for understanding stellar behavior which can be useful for further astrophysical analysis and scientific research.

### Needed libraries
The list below is a brief description of each of the libraries and tools I've used for processing the data.
1. **pandas**: A library used for data manipulation and analysis, especially useful for handling structured data such as DataFrames.
2. **numpy**: A fundamental package for numerical computation in Python, providing support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions
3. **sklearn.neighbors (KNeighborsClassifier)**: A machine learning classifier that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification tasks by finding the closest data points.
4. **re**: A library for working with regular expressions, allowing for pattern matching and text manipulation.
5. **sklearn.preprocessing (StandardScaler)**: A tool to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, often necessary for machine learning models to perform well.
6. **sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split)**: A function that splits your dataset into training and testing subsets, ensuring fair evaluation of machine learning models.
7. **matplotlib.pyplot (plt)**: A sub-library of matplotlib that provides a MATLAB-like interface for making plots.
8. **seaborn**: A data visualization library built on top of matplotlib, providing high-level functions to create attractive and informative statistical graphics.
9. **%matplotlib inline**: A magic function specific to Jupyter notebooks that ensures that plots are displayed inline, within the notebook.
10. **sklearn.linear_model (linear_model)**: Provides various linear models for regression and classification tasks, such as `LinearRegression` or `LogisticRegression`.
11. **sklearn.metrics (mean_absolute_error, root_mean_squared_error, r2_score)**: A module containing functions to evaluate the performance of machine learning models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the RÂ² score.
